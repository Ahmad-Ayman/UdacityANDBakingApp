    <string name="about_app">You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library. As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.</string>
